# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- Per-collection subdirectories - each collection gets its own named subfolder in the mods directory
- File conflict reporting after sync and deploy - shows which mods overwrote shared files
- Automatic version check - prints an upgrade notice if a newer release is available on GitHub
- `--no-extract` flag for sync, update, add, and import - keeps archives intact for external mod managers
- Resumable sync - re-running sync skips already-downloaded mods

### Fixed

- Download progress display - shows one active bar instead of stacking all completed bars
- Incremental state saves after each mod download for abort resilience
- Collection subdirectory naming uses display name instead of slug
